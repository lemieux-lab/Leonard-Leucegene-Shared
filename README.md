# Visualizations of the Leucegene dataset with dimensionality reduction

## Introduction
In this report, we will investigate a subset of Gene Expression profiles coming from the Leucegene dataset. We will use both PCA, and t-SNE to perform dimensionality reduction on the data. This will provide visualizations of the data as well as highlighting putative cancer subgroups by eye. By correlating the most contributing genes to the PCA, we will assign each PC to a major ontology if it exists. 

## Data

### Load data, and inspect the shape of data matrix

### Separate data in 2
    * The Leucegene full transcriptome (60K transcripts)
    * The Leucegene Coding transcriptome (22K coding sequences)
